### Project: NotionUS

**NotionUS** is a lightweight but powerful application that can help you to manage your assignments and tasks. It sports
a sleek and minimalist design which allows you to clearly see your outstanding tasks at a glance. It provides a command
line user interface which aids fast typists in managing their assignments quickly, while still providing the benefits of
a graphical user interface.
