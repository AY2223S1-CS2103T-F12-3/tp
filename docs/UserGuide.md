--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
   1. To check if you have Java installed, please open up a terminal (search for `Command Prompt` on Windows and 
      `Terminal` on Mac OS) and type in `java -version`. This will show your java version, if you have it installed.
   2. If you do not have Java 11 or above installed, please proceed to this [link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11)
      and download the appropriate Java for your operating system.


2. Download the latest NotionUS.jar from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/releases/).

3. Move the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for NotionUS. Note that a new folder will be created
   in the same location as the file, which will contain the application data.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. As seen below, some sample data has been pre-loaded for you to experiment with.

## Understanding the GUI

We would first like to give a walk-around of the User Interface (UI) to allow you, the user to have a smoother experience as you will 
be able to use the app to its full potential.

Here is an image of the UI of the app.

![GUIwalkaround](images/user-guide/GUIwalkaround.png)


From top to bottom:
1. `Help` and `Archived` Buttons:
    * Click `Help` to open the help menu which will display a list of example commands and a link to our user guide.
    * Click `Archived` to open the archived tasks window, which shows any previously archived tasks.

2. Filter status display:
    * This displays any filters applied on the list using commands such as `ls` or `find`, for more information
      please refer to the [**Features**](#features) section below.

3. Main task list:
    * This displays all your *current* tasks.

4. Result display:
    * The result display displays any information regarding command inputs, such as success or errors.

5. Command box:
    * This is where you enter commands to control the app.

### Autocomplete

When the user starts to type in the start of a command in the _Command Box_, a pop-up menu will appear with options to complete your input.
Use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through the options and press the `Enter` key to fill the command box with the command
of your choice.

Here is an example of autocomplete in action:

![Autocomplete](images/user-guide/Autocomplete.png)

However, it is recommended to read through the [Features](#features) section to understand the syntax for commands that require additional input.

### Command history : `Up`/`Down` keys
Loads previous command into the _Command Box_.
While the _Command Box_ is in focus, use the `Up` and `Down` arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through the command history that is automatically loaded in.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

Before proceeding, do make sure that you can understand our notation for command formats:

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info" >

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**

* Words in `lower_case` are commands or flags to be typed as-is 
  * e.g. in `ls -t TAG_NAME`, `ls -t` must be typed as-is and is case-sensitive 
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are values of parameters to be supplied by the user
  * e.g. in `ls -d DATE`, `DATE` refers to the value of the `-d` parameter supplied to the `ls` command 
* Words in `[Square brackets]` are optional parameters 
  * e.g. in `add -n TASK_NAME -m MODULE [-d DATE] [-t TAG_NAME]*`, `[-d DATE]` and `[-t TAG_NAME]*` can be omitted 
* Words that are followed by `*` are parameters that can be used multiple times
  * e.g. in `tag TASK_NUMBER (-t TAG_NAME)*`, `-t TAG_NAME` can be included multiple times
* Command parameters (e.g. `-a`, `-m`) can be made in any order
  * e.g. `ls -u --module CS2103T` and `ls --module CS2103T -u` will give the same result
* If a parameter is expected only once in a command but was specified multiple times, the last occurrence of it will be taken
  * e.g. if you enter `edit 1 -d 2022-10-22 -d 2022-10-30`, this will be interpreted as `edit 1 -d 2022-10-30`
* Extraneous parameters for commands (i.e. `help`, `showarchive`, etc.) or flags (i.e. `-a`, `-u`, etc.) that do not take in parameters will be ignored
  * e.g. if you enter `showarchive 2103`, this will be interpreted as `showarchive`
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Additional information about task constraints:**

* Task names can only contain letters, numbers and spaces. For example, `Assignment-5` is not a valid name as it
  contains a hypen.
* Dates must be written in the format YYYY-MM-DD, eg `2022-10-30`.
* Module names and tags can only contain letters and numbers, no spaces allowed.

* Commands that filter for names find names that **contain** the keyword. (`ls -n`, `find`) 
* Commands that filter for tags find tags that **match** the keyword. (`ls -t`, `find`)

</div>


### Getting help : `help`

Displays list of commands and information about NotionUS.

![Screenshot of Help Window](images/user-guide/HelpDemo.png)

Format: `help`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Shortcut key: <kbd>F1</kbd> 
</div>

### Adding a task: `add`

Adds a task to the task list.

Format: `add -n TASK_NAME -m MODULE [-d DATE] [-t TAG_NAME]*`

**Reminder**: Params in `[]` are **optional**, and `-t TAG_NAME` can be used multiple times.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about usage of the add command:**
* **Duplicate detection** - If you try to add in a task with the same name and module as an existing task,
  we will inform you that such a task already exists within the task list and reject your command
* **Optional deadlines** - Tasks with no deadlines are treated as being due "far in the future", meaning they
  will be placed at the end of the task list.
* **Ordering of tasks** - Tasks are first ordered by their deadlines, followed by the module name and then the task
  name, in alphabetical order.
</div>


Examples:
* `add -n Task 1 -m CS2103T -d 2022-10-15 -t homework`
* `add -n Tutorial 3 -m CS2103T`
* `add -n Tutorial 12 -m CS2103T -d 2022-10-28 -t tutorial`

### Editing a task : `edit`

Edits an existing task in the task list, at least one field needs to be edited.

Format: `edit TASK_NUMBER [-n TASK_NAME] [-m MODULE] [-d DATE] [-t TAG_NAME]*`

**Reminder**: Parameters in `[]` are **optional**, and `-t TAG_NAME` can be used multiple times.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about usage of the edit command:**
* **Duplicate detection** - If you try to edit the task such that it will have the same name and module as another task,
  we will inform you that such a task already exists within the task list and reject your command
* **Deadline removal** - Run the edit command with `-d` without specifying a date, eg `edit 1 -d`.
* **Tags deletion** - Similar to above, run the edit command with `-t` without specifying a tag, eg `edit 3 -t`
</div>

Examples:
* `edit 1 -t revision -n Recitation` Edits the tag to "revision" and taskName to "Recitation".

![Example image of Edot Command](images/user-guide/EditCommandDemo.png)

### Deleting a task : `delete`

* `delete 3`
    * Deletes third task in the task list.
    * Remaining tasksâ€™ `TASK_NUMBER` will be automatically updated.

![Before image of Delete Command](images/user-guide/DeleteCommandBefore.png)
![After image of Delete Command](images/user-guide/DeleteCommandAfter.png)

### Marking a task as completed: `mark`

Mark a task as complete.

Note: Using `mark` on a task already marked as complete will not change its completion status.

Format: `mark TASK_NUMBER`

Example: `mark 2`

![Example image of Mark Command](images/user-guide/MarkCommandDemo.png)

### Unmarking a task: `unmark`

Unmark a task, ie mark a task as incomplete.

Note: Using `unmark` on a task that is not complete will not change its completion status.

Format: `unmark TASK_NUMBER`

Example: `unmark 2`

### Tagging a task: `tag`

Allows you to tag a task.

Format : `tag TASK_NUMBER (-t TAG_NAME)*`
* `TASK_NUMBER`: This is the number of the task currently displayed.
* `TAG_NAME`: The word to tag the task with, should be alphanumeric, i.e. must not contain any spaces.
* `(-t TAG_NAME)`: You may add more than one tag by adding `-t TAG_2` after your first tag.

Example: `tag 1 -t optional`

![Example image of Tag Command](images/user-guide/TagCommandDemo.png)

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries of tasks in the task list.

Format: `clear`


### List : `ls`

`ls` commands filter the task list. There are multiple ways to filter the task list, such as
listing all tasks, unmarked tasks, all tasks under a module name, etc. You may apply multiple list flags in one
command to filter a list down to the results you are looking for. To reset the list, use the command `ls -a`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Notes about usage of the list command:**

* Any command that searches for names finds all task names that contain the keyword and does not have to be an exact match. It is also case-insensitive. 
* Any command that searches for tags finds all tags that exactly match, but is also case-insensitive.
</div>

Current filters applied will be shown in the UI at the top bar.

![Before image of List Command](images/user-guide/ListCommandBefore.png)
![After image of List Command](images/user-guide/ListCommandAfter.png)

**Note that `find` searches globally, across all of a task's attributes**

#### Listing all tasks : `ls -a`

Shows a list of all tasks in the task list.

Format: `ls -a`

#### Listing all unmarked tasks : `ls -u`

Shows a list of all unmarked tasks in the task list, i.e. shows a list of uncompleted tasks.

Format: `ls -u`

#### Listing all marked tasks : `ls -m`

Shows a list of all marked tasks in the task list, i.e. shows a list of completed tasks.

Format: `ls -m`

#### Listing all tasks under the same module : `ls --module`

Shows a list of all tasks under the same module.

Format: `ls --module MODULE`
* `MODULE`: Should be alphanumeric, i.e. must not contain any spaces.

Example: `ls --module cs2103t`

#### Listing all tasks containing the same tag : `ls -t`

Shows a list of tasks whose tags match **exactly** with the tag_name. (Case-insensitive)

Format: `ls -t TAG_NAME`

* `TAG_NAME`: The tag you are looking for should be an exact match and alphanumeric, ie must not contain any spaces.

Example: `ls -t highPriority` will find tags with `highpriority` (Case-insensitive)

#### Listing all tasks with deadline on or after a date : `ls -d`

Shows a list of all tasks with deadline on or after the inputted date.

As tasks with no deadline can be considered to be due "far in the future", this command will always list tasks with no
deadlines.

Format: `ls -d DATE`
* `DATE`: Must be in the format of YYYY-MM-DD.

Example: `ls -d 2022-11-11`

#### Listing all task names with the matching keywords: `ls -n`

Format: `ls -n KEYWORD*`
* `KEYWORD`: One or more keywords can be provided. Each keyword should consist of only letters and numbers, and are separated by spaces.

Example: `ls -n task1`

### Find tasks by name : `find`

The `find` command finds the task names that **contain** the keywords and tags which **exactly match** with the 
keywords. Meaning that names does not have to be an exact match (Example: searching `tap` with return a task with a 
task name `tape`). `find` is not case-sensitive.

Format: `find KEYWORD/TAG_NAME*`
* `KEYWORD/TAG_NAME`: One keyword/tag name or multiple, which should be alphanumeric and separated by spaces.

Singular word search example: `find tut`
finds names which contain `tut` and any tag that exactly match `tut`.

Example singular word search: ![FindCommandSingular](images/user-guide/FindCommandSingular.png)

Multiple word search example: `find Week tut`
finds **any** task name that contain keywords `week` or `tut` or **any** tag that match them.
<br>(Note that it is not limited to only 2 keywords)

Example multiple word search: ![FindCommandMultiple](images/user-guide/FindCommandMultiple.png)
